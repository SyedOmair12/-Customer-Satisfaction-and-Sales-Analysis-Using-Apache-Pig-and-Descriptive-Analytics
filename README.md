Conducted a detailed analysis of customer satisfaction trends, top-selling products, and loyal customer behaviors over a two-year period (2012–2013).

Utilized Apache Pig (Pig Latin) to process large datasets, clean data, calculate average feedback scores, and identify outliers.

Visualized trends through bar and line graphs to better understand customer satisfaction patterns and sales performance.

Key findings included:

Customer satisfaction remained consistent over the two years.

Products 1274348, 1274673, and 1274021 were top-selling, with 1274673 having the lowest satisfaction score (1.11/5).

Identified that 65% of customers did not return, while 9.2% placed three or more orders.

Provided actionable recommendations to improve customer retention and maximize sales.

Strengthened ETL and big data processing skills by employing Apache Pig on Hadoop clusters.
